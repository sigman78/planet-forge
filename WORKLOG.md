- **02:55** Scaffolded the repo (vite 8, three 0.186, tweakpane 4, vitest, TS 5.9).
  Wrote `CONTRACT.md`, `src/core/cube.ts` (tan-warped cube sphere, 1-texel gutters, bilinear `sampleDir`, `refillGutters`),
  its GLSL twin `src/shaders/cube.glsl`, and `src/core/types.ts` (PlanetData, 8 fixed splat layers). Cube tests pass.
- Decisions:
  - Live generation runs in TS Web Workers so the viewer controls respond immediately. Python (uv) handles offline assets: the texture pack and the HDR sky.
  - Custom `ShaderMaterial` with its own GGX instead of patching `MeshStandardMaterial`. There is one sun plus ambient, and owning the shader keeps it portable to the CDLOD engine.
  - Height, splat and climate are stored as 6-layer `DataArrayTexture`s, which matches the engine's cube-face tiles.
  - Erosion is a whole-cube pass. Buffers are transferred between workers (no SharedArrayBuffer, so no COOP/COEP headers needed).
- **03:10** Asset agents (Sonnet) finished:
  - Sky: `tools/make_sky.py` writes a procedural Milky Way (`public/sky/milkyway.hdr`, RGBE 2048×1024) and 15k blackbody-coloured stars (`stars.bin`). Preview is in `docs/sky_preview.jpg`.
  - Textures: `tools/fetch_textures.py` pulls 8 CC0 ambientCG sets (2K, downsampled to 1K) and packs albedo/normal(GL)/ORM/height plus a synthesized FFT water normal. 20.9 MB total. See `public/textures/ATTRIBUTION.md` and `docs/textures_preview.jpg`.
  - The generator agent (Opus) is still running. Renderer work has started in `src/render`.
